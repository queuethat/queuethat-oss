-- 2B-Q6 (#231): the join page offers the location-level flow when the location routes (Q-11).
--
-- Expand-only: api.location_public gains a trailing attribute `routing`; existing readers are
-- untouched. It tells an anonymous caller only that some rule is active, which the join page needs
-- to pick its flow; the rules themselves stay staff-only.
-- redefines api.get_location_public from 20261030114500_public_location_retention.sql

comment on function api.get_location_public(text) is
  'Public view of a location by its slug (or a redirected old slug; slug is always the current '
  'one): name, contact, country (null when not set), and each non-archived queue with its '
  'accepting state and reason, waiting count, ETA for someone joining now, pulse topic and '
  'active services. Reasons are those of queue_not_accepting_reason, then ''online_full'' when '
  'the queue reached its hourly online-join ceiling (join_queue would refuse it with '
  'rate_limited, DETAIL queue_total); staff can still add guests then. captcha_site_key is the '
  'Turnstile site key when online joins need a pass (api.issue_join_pass), else null. Contains '
  'no guest data. retention_days is how long the business keeps guest contact details. routing is true when the location has an active routing rule aimed at a live queue: the join page then offers a service picker and joins the location rather than a queue (api.join_queue with p_location_id). Raises not_found for an unknown slug.';
