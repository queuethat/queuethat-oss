-- #498 follow-up (browser run 6): at the hourly online ceiling the join page showed a form and
-- Join stayed enabled until the guest tried. get_location_public now reports such a queue as not
-- accepting with reason 'online_full', from app.online_joins_paused_until, the same rule
-- take_join_slot enforces. Only the public join view changes: queue_not_accepting_reason still
-- governs every entry point, and staff and kiosk adds are not limited by the online ceiling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- redefines api.get_location_public from 20261025004900_location_country.sql
-- get_location_public: the 004900 body, with the online ceiling folded into the reason

comment on function api.get_location_public(text) is
  'Public view of a location by its slug (or a redirected old slug; slug is always the current '
  'one): name, contact, country (null when not set), and each non-archived queue with its '
  'accepting state and reason, waiting count, ETA for someone joining now, pulse topic and '
  'active services. Reasons are those of queue_not_accepting_reason, then ''online_full'' when '
  'the queue reached its hourly online-join ceiling (join_queue would refuse it with '
  'rate_limited, DETAIL queue_total); staff can still add guests then. Contains no guest data. '
  'Raises not_found for an unknown slug.';
