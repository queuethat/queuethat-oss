-- The `joined` alert goes out the moment someone joins, with no staff action, so an address typed
-- into the join form (unverified) must not receive it: anyone could aim it at a victim. It is
-- skipped until the address is verified, which in practice means a guest contact; push and the
-- guest's own status page still confirm the place. Other triggers need a staff action or a
-- position change and keep the one-live-visit-per-address rule below.
